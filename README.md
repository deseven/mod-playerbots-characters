`mod-playerbots-characters` (or `mod-pbc` for short) is an [AzerothCore](https://www.azerothcore.org) module built around [mod-playerbots](https://github.com/mod-playerbots/mod-playerbots), breathing new life into bots by turning them into true in-game characters — companions with pre-defined personalities, memory, and relationships. Heavily inspired by [mod-ollama-chat](https://github.com/DustinHendrickson/mod-ollama-chat), but taking a different, more complex approach — focusing on the roleplaying experience rather than emulating real WoW players.

Think old Bioware games with companions — that's the core idea. The intended use is a fresh start at low rates with a full party of altbots playing alongside you, developing their own stories as you progress through the game together.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The module is currently in active development and things could be changing rapidly. Before updating your copy, it's highly recommended to do a database backup, read the changes and notes in [the Releases](https://github.com/deseven/mod-pbc/releases) and check your server logs after running the newer version. There should be no hard incompatibilities, but new config variables are getting added, existing ones change their defaults, old routines get replaced and so on.


## How It Works

This module extends the bots provided by `mod-playerbots` into full characters — giving them a voice, memories, relationships, and the ability to react to events and converse with companions. The bot logic (combat, movement, questing) remains entirely untouched; this module only adds the personality layer on top.

Characters react to in-game events (chat, item pickups, duels, level-ups, boss kills, quests) based on configurable reply chances. When a character rolls to respond, a prompt is built from its character card, chat history, relationships, live context, and the event itself — then sent to a compatible LLM API, and the response is spoken by the character in-game.

Over time, chat history grows. When it reaches the configured token limit, a condensation process extracts discrete narrator-style memories with importance scores from the history, then clears all history. These memories are selected by importance at prompt-build time within a token budget, keeping the in-memory context bounded while preserving what matters. This way, characters gradually develop lasting memories and personality traits.

Relationships are tracked between characters and real players, as well as other characters. When a name is mentioned enough times in a character's history, a relationship update is triggered — generating or updating a brief description of how the character feels about that person. These are included in future prompts, giving characters continuity with their companions.

The module supports multiple languages based on the server's `DBC.Locale` setting:
- enUS (default, picked if the needed locale is not found)
- deDE
- ruRU


## Installation

Since mod-playerbots is an obvious hard requirement, follow their [Installation Guide](https://github.com/mod-playerbots/mod-playerbots/wiki/Installation-Guide) until you have a working acore installation with playerbots enabled.

There are three ways to obtain the module sources:

### Method 1: Specific release tag (recommended)

Clone a specific tagged release:

```sh
cd modules
git clone --depth 1 --branch <tag_name> git@github.com:deseven/mod-pbc.git
```

> [!NOTE]
> For tags `2026-08-10` and older (before the repo was renamed from `mod-playerbots-characters` to `mod-pbc`), append the old folder name to the clone command, i.e. `git clone --depth 1 --branch 2026-08-10 git@github.com:deseven/mod-pbc.git mod-playerbots-characters`

When you want to upgrade to a newer release tag:

```sh
cd modules/mod-pbc
git fetch --tags
git checkout <new_tag_name>
```

A list of all available tags can be found on the [Releases](https://github.com/deseven/mod-pbc/releases) page.

### Method 2: Source code archive

Download a `.zip` or `.tar.gz` source archive from the [Releases](https://github.com/deseven/mod-pbc/releases) page and extract it into the `modules` directory. The extracted folder must be named `mod-pbc` or `mod-playerbots-characters` (legacy fallback).

### Method 3: Latest (bleeding edge)

Clone the repository normally to get the latest changes:

```sh
cd modules
git clone git@github.com:deseven/mod-pbc.git
```

This gives you the most recent commits from the `main` branch. You can `git pull` at any time to update.

After obtaining the sources using any of the methods above, rebuild the server normally.

> [!NOTE]
> The module includes bundled copies of [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) in `deps/nlohmann/json.hpp` and [yhirose/cpp-httplib](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib) in `deps/yhirose/cpp-httplib/httplib.h`, so no external libraries are required.

If [mod_weather_vibe](https://github.com/hermensbas/mod_weather_vibe) is also installed, weather states from it will be included in the character's scene description.


## Configuration

Copy `env/dist/etc/modules/playerbots_characters.conf.dist` as `env/dist/etc/modules/playerbots_characters.conf` and adjust it as needed.


### Model Connection Setup

Each LLM connection is defined in a standalone JSONC file (JSON with comments). To get started, pick one of the ready-made `.jsonc.example` templates in the [`connections/`](connections/) directory, copy it to a new file **without** the `.example` suffix, and point the relevant config parameter at it. For the full setup guide — supported API types, config parameters, tested providers and per-task routing — see [Model Connections](docs/CONNECTIONS.md).

After configuring, use `.chars connection-test` (optionally with a connection name like `utility`) to verify that a connection is working.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due to the complexity and length of the prompts, locally-run models on average home hardware will generally struggle and produce low-quality output as context grows. A cloud-based model with a large context window is recommended. Make sure to also adjust `PBC.MaxHistoryCtx` accordingly — a good starting point is around 25% of the model's total context window. Aim for at least 32k in general, anything less could lead to poor efficiency of character relationship tracking and memory extraction.


### HTTP Server & Web App

![PBC Web App](https://d7.wtf/s/pbc-web.png)

The module can optionally run a built-in HTTP/WS server with a web frontend, providing an interface for managing the characters, as well as an API for external tools and integrations. The web interface supports viewing and editing chat history, relationships and memories. This is disabled by default and could be enabled in the config, read the `HTTP SERVER` section and follow the comments there.

> [!NOTE]
> If you plan to use the web app for a considerable amount of time without touching the game, it's also recommended to set `PreventAFKLogout` to `2` in your `worldserver.conf`.

### Playerbots Adjustments

Recommended adjustments to the playerbots config (`playerbots.conf`), to make bots less talkative in order to not interfere with the new character logic:

| Setting | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `AiPlayerbot.EnableBroadcasts` | 0 | Disables loot / quest / kill broadcasts |
| `AiPlayerbot.RandomBotTalk` | 0 | Disables random talking in say / yell / general channels |
| `AiPlayerbot.RandomBotEmote` | 0 | Disables random emoting |
| `AiPlayerbot.RandomBotSuggestDungeons` | 0 | Disables dungeon suggestions in chat |
| `AiPlayerbot.EnableGreet` | 0 | Disables greeting when invited |
| `AiPlayerbot.GuildFeedback` | 0 | Disables guild event chatting |
| `AiPlayerbot.RandomBotSayWithoutMaster` | 0 | Disables bots talking without a master |
| `AiPlayerbot.RPWarningCooldown` | 999999 | Increases delay between "missing reagents" messages and such |
| `AiPlayerbot.EnableAutoTradeOnItemMention` | 0 | Disables automatic trades and item listings on item mention (from [mod-playerbots@8caf37a](https://github.com/mod-playerbots/mod-playerbots/commit/8caf37af97b74545f8fa65172095803466ad8a06)) |


## Usage

Start the server, set up some altbots for yourself or invite existing random bots, then write cards for them as you see fit. See `characters/Example.card.txt` for an example of how to write a character card. The character name in the filename must match the in-game character name exactly to be picked up. It is recommended to write cards in second person (using "you/your"), because default prompts and request structure follow this format.

Start playing, chat with your characters, discuss anything you like, build relationships and enjoy the game.

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on the model you are using, your mileage may vary. Do regular backups with `modules/mod-pbc/tools/pbc_backup.sh` and adjust things as needed either in the database (followed by `.chars reload` command) or via the included web app. There are also two helper tools (`pbc_info.sh` and `pbc_history.sh`) which might help with tracking what's going on. You can also steer the narration a bit by using `.chars narrate` and `.chars narrate-party` commands. Check out [available commands](docs/COMMANDS.md) for more info.

### Web App

If you have the HTTP server configured, you can use `.chars web` command to get a one-time password that you can then use to authorize in the web app.

## Debugging

Two config options control debug output:

- `PBC.DebugEnabled` — enables general debug logging (event dispatching, roll chances, etc.)
- `PBC.DebugShowFullRequest` — when enabled alongside `DebugEnabled`, logs the full request body and response body for every LLM API call. Useful for diagnosing issues with non-standard API providers where the response format may differ from OpenAI's.
